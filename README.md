# MeltdownKernelPatchCheck
Super simplified linux script to check if your kernel has been patched.

## How to Use
Either clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/TheNaterz/MeltdownKernelPatchCheck
cd MeltdownKernelPatchCheck
```
or simply
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheNaterz/MeltdownKernelPatchCheck/master/check.sh
```
Then run the script with
```
chmod +x check.sh
./check.sh
```

This will be updated to include whether your cpu is vulnerable after the kernel has been patched.
